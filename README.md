VIDA AI Agent is an intelligent assistant designed to take natural language input from guests and process it through specialized AI agents. The system is built to provide seamless interactions, personalized responses, and actionable outputsâ€”making it feel like a true concierge or digital host.

ðŸš€ User Experience
1. Guest Interaction

Guests interact with VIDA through text input (chat interface, form, or integrated widget).

They can ask questions, make requests, or provide context in natural language.

2. AI Processing

VIDA routes the request to one or more AI agents depending on the task.

Each agent specializes in specific functions (e.g., answering FAQs, recommending services, processing requests, or analyzing guest intent).

The system combines outputs from multiple agents into a single, coherent response.

3. Response Delivery

Guests receive a clear, concise, and context-aware response in real time.

If further clarification is needed, VIDA continues the conversation naturally.

4. Continuous Learning

The system improves over time by learning from guest interactions.

It adapts to patterns, preferences, and new use cases.
